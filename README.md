# WebApp-Security-OWASP10
"This repository contains my hands-on writeups of the OWASP Top 10 (2021). For each vulnerability, I document how it works, how it can be exploited (with examples from DVWA/Juice Shop), and how to fix it. This is a knowledge resource to help others understand real-world attacks and defenses."
